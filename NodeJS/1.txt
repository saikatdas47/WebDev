/**
 * Node.js Overview
 * 
 * What is Node.js?
 * Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code
 * outside of a web browser, typically on servers and backend systems.
 * 
 * How is Node.js different from JavaScript?
 * - JavaScript is a programming language originally designed for web browsers
 * - Node.js is a runtime that executes JavaScript on the server-side
 * - Node.js provides additional modules (fs, http, os, etc.) not available in browser JavaScript
 * - Node.js has access to the operating system and file system
 * - Browser JavaScript is restricted for security reasons; Node.js has fewer restrictions
 * 
 * Why do we need Node.js?
 * - Server-side development: Build backend servers and APIs
 * - Full-stack JavaScript: Use one language for both frontend and backend
 * - Asynchronous operations: Handle multiple concurrent operations efficiently
 * - NPM ecosystem: Access to hundreds of thousands of reusable packages
 * - Scalability: Event-driven, non-blocking I/O model handles high concurrency
 * - Command-line tools: Build CLI applications and automation scripts
 * - Real-time applications: Create WebSocket-based real-time features

/**
 * Node.js Version Guidelines
 * 
 * - Current Release: Latest features, 6-month support window
 *   Use for: Development, experimentation, latest features
 * 
 * - LTS (Long Term Support): Stable, production-ready versions
 *   Support Duration: 30 months (10 months active + 20 months maintenance)
 *   Use for: Production applications, long-term stability requirements
 * 
 * Recommendation: Use LTS for production applications, Current for development

/**
 * Browser APIs NOT available in Node.js
 * 
 * DOM Manipulation
 * - document object: No DOM in Node.js (server-side only)
 * - getElementById(), querySelector(), etc.: Not available
 * - innerHTML, appendChild(), etc.: Cannot manipulate non-existent DOM
 * - Use cases: React, Vue, Angular run in browsers; Node.js doesn't render HTML
 * 
 * Browser-specific Objects
 * - window object: Global object in browsers, not in Node.js (use global instead)
 * - localStorage, sessionStorage: Browser storage APIs unavailable
 * - alert(), confirm(), prompt(): Browser dialog functions
 * - fetch() API: Available in modern Node.js but not all versions
 * - XMLHttpRequest: Old browser API (use fetch or http module instead)
 * 
 * Events
 * - addEventListener(): Browser event system
 * - mouse/keyboard events: No user interactions in server environment
 * 
 * APIs exclusive to Browsers
 * - Geolocation API
 * - Canvas API
 * - WebGL
 * - Service Workers
 * - Web Audio API
 * - Notifications API
 * 
 * Why? Node.js runs on servers without a graphical interface or user interaction.
 * It focuses on file system, networking, and backend logic instead.

## What is npm?
npm is the default package manager for Node.js. It is a command-line tool that allows developers to install, manage, and share reusable packages of code (libraries and frameworks) from the npm registry.

## Why do we need it?

### Dependency Management
- Automatically downloads and manages project dependencies
- Tracks package versions in `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
- Ensures consistent versions across different environments

### Build Automation
- The `npm run build` command executes custom scripts defined in `package.json`
- Automates compilation, bundling, and minification of source code
- Streamlines development workflow by running predefined build tasks

### Code Reusability
- Access to millions of open-source packages
- Avoid reinventing the wheel by using existing, tested libraries
- Accelerates development by leveraging community-built solutions

### Version Control
- Manages package versions and updates
- Prevents breaking changes through semantic versioning
- Allows teams to maintain consistent development environments

### Project Scalability
- Simplifies managing complex projects with many dependencies
- Facilitates collaborative development
- Makes it easy to update and maintain packages over time
npm run build









## npm init Command
`npm init` is used to create a new `package.json` file for your Node.js project.

### What it does:
- Prompts you to enter project details (name, version, description, entry point, etc.)
- Creates a `package.json` file that stores project metadata and dependencies
- Sets up the configuration for your project

### package.json Structure:
{
  "name": "helloworld",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "author": "saikat",
  "type": "commonjs",
  "main": "hello.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "node hello.js" //ata pore add kora lage nijer pochondo moto nam diye start er jaigai.
  }
}

saikatdas@Saikats-MacBook-Air helloworld % npm run start /npm start

> helloworld@1.0.0 start



Used 1 reference
The provided excerpt from 1.txt includes a section on the structure of a package.json file, which is crucial for any Node.js project. Here's a breakdown of its components:

Example Explanation of package.json Structure
Key Components Explained:
name: Identifies the project. It should be unique if published to the npm registry.
version: Follows semantic versioning (major.minor.patch) to indicate the project's version.
description: Provides a brief overview of what the project does.
license: Specifies the licensing terms for the project.
author: Indicates who created the project.
type: Defines the module system; commonjs is standard for Node.js.
main: Points to the main file that runs when the project is started.
scripts: Contains commands that can be executed via npm. For example, npm run start executes the command defined under start, which runs node hello.js.
Usage Example
When you run the command npm run start, it triggers the script defined in the package.json, which in this case starts the application by executing hello.js. This is a common practice in Node.js projects to streamline the process of running applications and managing dependencies.
