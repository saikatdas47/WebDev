Example (Express + EJS):

1. Install EJS:
npm install ejs

2. index.js e add koren:

const app = express();

app.set('view engine', 'ejs');

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.render('index', { title: 'Home Page' });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});

//Authentication https://youtu.be/OWeruyqhiTo?si=c7RYNp_LMjyuKfae
/*
 Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system.
 It ensures that the entity requesting access is who it claims to be, typically
 through credentials such as usernames, passwords, tokens, or biometric data.
 Authentication is a fundamental security mechanism in software applications.

Authentication can be stateful or stateless:

1. Stateful Authentication:
- The server keeps track of user sessions (usually with session IDs stored in cookies).
- When a user logs in, the server creates a session and stores it (in memory, database, etc.).
- Each request from the client includes the session ID, and the server checks it to authenticate the user.
- Example: Express-session middleware.

2. Stateless Authentication:
- The server does not store any session data.
- Authentication info (like JWT token) is sent with every request (usually in headers).
- The server verifies the token on each request, but does not keep any session state.
- Example: JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

Summary:
- Stateful: Server stores session, good for traditional web apps.
- Stateless: No server-side session, scalable, good for APIs and microservices.

Authentication Process:
1. User submits credentials (username/password) to the server.
2. Server verifies credentials:
    - If valid, server authenticates the user.
    - If using stateful auth, server creates a session and sends a session ID (often in a cookie) to the client.
    - If using stateless auth, server generates a token (like JWT) and sends it to the client (often in a response header or body).

Cookies:
- Cookies are small pieces of data stored on the client by the browser.
- Servers use cookies to store session IDs or tokens for authentication.
- Cookies are automatically sent by the browser with every request to the server for the same domain.

Response & Headers:
- After successful authentication, the server sends a response to the client.
- Authentication info (session ID or token) is often sent in the response header (e.g., 'Set-Cookie' for sessions, or custom header for JWT).
- On subsequent requests, the client includes the authentication info in request headers (e.g., 'Cookie' header or 'Authorization' header).

Why use cookies and headers:
- Cookies are convenient for browser-based apps because they are managed automatically.
- Headers (like 'Authorization') are flexible and commonly used for APIs and mobile apps.
- Both methods allow the server to identify and authenticate users on each request.

/*
Using `uuid` for Session IDs in Authentication (Stateful Auth):

1. Install uuid:
npm install uuid

2. How it works:
- When a user logs in with valid credentials, the server generates a unique session ID using `uuid`.
- This session ID is stored on the server (in memory, database, or session store) along with user info.
- The session ID is sent to the client as a cookie (using the 'Set-Cookie' header).
- On each subsequent request, the browser automatically sends the session ID cookie.
- The server checks the session ID from the cookie, finds the session, and authenticates the user.

Example (Express, uuid, cookie-parser):

const express = require('express');
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
const { v4: uuidv4 } = require('uuid');

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
app.use(cookieParser());

const sessions = {}; // In-memory session store

app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
    const { username, password } = req.body;
    // Validate credentials (pseudo code)
    if (username === 'admin' && password === 'password') {
        const sessionId = uuidv4();
        sessions[sessionId] = { username };
        res.cookie('sessionId', sessionId, { httpOnly: true });
        res.send('Logged in!');
    } else {
        res.status(401).send('Invalid credentials');
    }
});

app.get('/dashboard', (req, res) => {
    const sessionId = req.cookies.sessionId;
    if (sessionId && sessions[sessionId]) {
        res.send(`Welcome, ${sessions[sessionId].username}`);
    } else {
        res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');
    }
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});

Summary:
- uuid generates a unique session ID for each user session.
- Session ID is stored server-side and sent to client as a cookie.
- Client sends session ID cookie with each request.
- Server uses session ID to authenticate user.
- This is stateful authentication using uuid for unique session IDs.
