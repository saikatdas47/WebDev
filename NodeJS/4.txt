//HTTP Methods
// HTTP methods are used to indicate the desired action to be performed on a resource in a web server.
// The most common HTTP methods are:

// 1. GET: Requests data from a specified resource. It should only retrieve data and have no other effect.
// 2. POST: Submits data to be processed to a specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.
// 3. PUT: Replaces all current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content.
// 4. PATCH: Partially modifies a resource. Only the specified changes are applied.
// 5. DELETE: Removes the specified resource from the server.
// 6. HEAD: Same as GET, but it transfers the status line and header section only, without the response body.
// 7. OPTIONS: Describes the communication options for the target resource.
// 8. TRACE: Performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.
// 9. CONNECT: Establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.

// Each method serves a specific purpose and is used according to the requirements of the application.

Express Framework:  % npm i express

Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications.

Why Express came into existence:
- Node.js provides basic HTTP server capabilities, but building complex web applications with just Node.js can be repetitive and time-consuming.
- Express was created to simplify the process of handling routes, requests, responses, middleware, and more.

Why we use Express:
- Simplifies routing and handling HTTP methods.
- Makes middleware integration easy for tasks like authentication, logging, and error handling.
- Provides utilities for serving static files, parsing request bodies, and managing cookies.
- Enables rapid development of RESTful APIs and web applications.

Problems without Express:
- You would need to manually handle routing, request parsing, and response formatting.
- Middleware management would be complex and less organized.
- Code would be more verbose and harder to maintain.
- Common tasks like error handling, serving static files, and parsing form data would require extra code.

In summary, Express streamlines web development in Node.js, making code cleaner, more maintainable, and easier to scale.

Package Versioning in Node.js (npm):

When you install packages using npm, you often see version numbers like "express": "^4.18.2" in package.json. These numbers and symbols control which versions of a package your project will use.

Semantic Versioning (semver):
- Format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 2.5.1)
    - MAJOR: Breaking changes
    - MINOR: New features, backward-compatible
    - PATCH: Bug fixes, backward-compatible

Symbols in package.json:
- ^ (Caret): Allows updates that do not change the leftmost non-zero digit. For example, "^1.2.3" matches "1.x.x" but not "2.0.0".
- ~ (Tilde): Allows updates to the most recent PATCH version. For example, "~1.2.3" matches "1.2.x" but not "1.3.0".
- No symbol: Installs the exact version specified.
- * (Asterisk): Matches any version.

Examples:
- "^2.3.4" → Accepts "2.3.4", "2.4.0", "2.9.9", but not "3.0.0"
- "~2.3.4" → Accepts "2.3.4", "2.3.5", but not "2.4.0"
- "2.3.4" → Only installs "2.3.4"

Why versioning matters:
- Ensures compatibility and stability.
- Allows you to control when to accept new features or breaking changes.
- Helps avoid unexpected bugs from automatic updates.

In summary, use "^" for safe feature updates, "~" for only bug fixes, and exact versions for maximum stability.

/*
RESTful API:

A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It uses HTTP methods to perform operations on resources, which are identified by URLs.

Key principles:
- Stateless: Each request from a client contains all the information needed to process it.
- Resources: Everything is a resource, accessible via a unique URL.
- HTTP Methods: Uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) to perform CRUD operations.
- Representation: Resources can be represented in different formats, commonly JSON or XML.

Example RESTful routes for a "users" resource:
- GET /users         → Retrieve all users
- GET /users/:id     → Retrieve a specific user
- POST /users        → Create a new user
- PUT /users/:id     → Replace a user
- PATCH /users/:id   → Update part of a user
- DELETE /users/:id  → Delete a user

RESTful APIs are widely used for building scalable and maintainable web services.

 * Sends data from the server to the client in < HTML document > format.
 * This approach is used when the server needs to deliver a fully-rendered web page or a fragment of HTML
 * that the client can directly display in the browser. Sending data as HTML is common in traditional web applications,
 * server-side rendering frameworks, or 
 
 when the client expects ready-to-render markup instead of raw data (like JSON or XML).
 * This reduces the need for client-side rendering logic and allows for faster initial page loads and improved SEO,
 * as the content is immediately available to the browser and search engines.  react, flutter etc
